    "Question_5": {
        "Question": "Newton's Third Law",
        "Answer": "If a body A exerts a force on a body B, then B exerts an equal and opposite force on A that is of the same type."
    },
    "Question_4": {
        "Question": "Newton's Second Law",
        "Answer": "The rate of change of a body's momentum is directly proportional to the force active upon it."
    },
    "Question_1": {
        "Question": "What is a Quantity",
        "Answer": "In S.I. a quantity is represented by a number and a unit, (e.g. m = 3.0 kg)."
    },
    "Question_7": {
        "Question": "Density of a material",
        "Answer": "Density is Mass / Volume The Mass per Unit volume is kgm^-3 in which mass and volume apple to any sample of the material"
    },
    "Question_6": {
        "Question": "Resolving a Vector into components in paticular directions",
        "Answer": "Resolving a  vector into components in particular directions This means finding vectors (the so-called components) in these directions, which add together vectorially to make the original vector, and so,together, are equivalent to this vector."
    },
    "Question_3": {
        "Question": "Newton's First Law",
        "Answer": "A body will remain in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted on by an external force."
    },
    "Question_2": {
        "Question": "What is a Vector",
        "Answer": "A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction."
    },
    "Question_8": {
        "Question": "Moment (or torque) of a force.",
        "Answer": "The moment (or torque) of a force about a point is defined as the force ï‚´ the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force, i.e.   moment = F x d."
    },
    "Question_9": {
        "Question": "The principle of Moments",
        "Answer": "The principle of moments. For a system to be in equilibrium, The sum of anticlockwise moments about a point = The sum of clockwise moments about the same point."
    },
    "Question_10": {
        "Question": "What is a Force",
        "Answer": "Force is a force or a force vector"
    }
